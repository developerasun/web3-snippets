# Web3 snippets

A repository where I archive every web3 codes.

Solidity and corresponding unit test codes is primary and other web3 materials like IPFS, provider, infra is secondary.

`assets` stores a bunch of json files and types for `EIPs`, `IPFS` metadata, and types generated from `typechain`.

`contracts` keeps Solidity codes.

`scripts` holds utility hooks for controlling contracts and infra.

`tests` has test suites for contracts and docker images.
